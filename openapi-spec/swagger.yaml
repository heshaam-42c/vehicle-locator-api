    # Get started

    Checkout.com provides a collection of APIs that enable you to integrate with our various products and services. 
    </br></br>

    Our APIs accept and return JSON in the HTTP body, and return standard <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/resources/codes/http-response-codes">HTTP response codes</a>. You can consume the APIs directly using any HTTP or REST library.
    </br></br>
    
    <a href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account">Sign up for a test account</a> to gain access to the sandbox environment, where you can test API calls without affecting live data.
    </br></br>

    For more information, see:

    - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/developer-resources/api/api-endpoints">API endpoints</a>

    # Base URLs

    The base URLs you must use for your API calls to the sandbox and production environments are unique to you.

    - Sandbox: `https://{prefix}.api.sandbox.checkout.com/{path}`

    - Production: `https://{prefix}.api.checkout.com/{path}`
    </br></br>

    The `{prefix}` value in each base URL is a string containing the first eight characters of each of your environments' unique `client_id`, excluding the `cli_` prefix. 

    To find your unique base URL: 

    1. Sign in to the Dashboard environment you want to retrieve the base URL for:

        - <a target="_blank" href="https://dashboard.sandbox.checkout.com">Sandbox</a>
      
        - <a target="_blank" href="https://dashboard.checkout.com">Production</a>

    2. Go to _Developers_ > _Overview_.
    <br/>Your unique base URL is displayed on the _Developer overview_ page. For example, `https://vkuhvk4v.api.checkout.com`.

    3. Alternatively, go to _Settings_ > _Account details_.
    <br/>Your unique base URL is displayed under _Connection settings_.

    </br></br>
    If you are unsure of your client ID or base URL for either environment, contact your account manager or <a target="_blank" href="https://dashboard.checkout.com/support/new?topic=case_configuration_change&issue=case_configuration_issue_operational_change_request">request support</a>.
    </br></br>

    For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/developer-resources/api/api-endpoints">API endpoints</a>.

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account, you can authenticate with either Access keys (OAuth 2.0), or Secret API keys.

    Unless explicitly stated, all endpoints require authentication using either your Access or Secret API Keys. Public keys should only be used in JavaScript or native applications.

    - <b>Client-side authentication</b>. Use your [public key](#section/Authentication/ApiPublicKey) for client-side authentication. It only has access to a limited set of our APIs – mostly those called as part of your payment environment.

    - <b>Server-to-server authentication</b>. Use your [secret key](#section/Authentication/ApiSecretKey) or [OAuth](#section/Authentication/OAuth) for server-to-server communication. Support for API keys depends on the endpoint.

    Never share your OAuth credentials, API keys, or access tokens. Keep them guarded and secure.

      operationId: provideDisputeEvidence
      description: >
        Adds supporting evidence to a dispute. Before using this endpoint, you first
        need to [upload your files](#tag/Disputes/paths/~1files/post) using the file
        uploader. You will receive a file id (prefixed by `file_`) which you can
        then use in your request.
        Note that this only attaches the evidence to the dispute, it does not send
        it to us. Once ready, you will need to submit it.
        **You must provide at least one evidence type in the body of your request.**

        Create an attempt for a [face authentication](https://www.checkout.com/docs/business-operations/manage-identities/authenticate-with-biometrics).
        
        If you've already created an attempt for this authentication, the [authentication status](https://www.checkout.com/docs/developer-resources/codes/identity-verification-codes#Face_Authentication_statuses) must be one of the following:
        
        - `created`
        - `pending`
        - `capture_in_progress`
        - `retry_required`
    
        If you create a new attempt while the status is any other value, you receive a `409 Conflict` response.

        Create an [identity verification](https://www.checkout.com/docs/business-operations/manage-identities/verify-identities) attempt.
        
        If you've already created an attempt for this verification, the [verification status](https://www.checkout.com/docs/developer-resources/codes/identities-codes) must be one of the following:
        
        - `created`
        - `pending`
        - `capture_in_progress`
        - `retry_required`
    
        If you create a new attempt while the status is any other value, you receive a `409 Conflict` response.

                This method requires you to provide the `apikey` query parameter value in the destination request.
      
                When used, the Forward API appends the `X-PAY-TOKEN` header to the outgoing HTTP request before forwarding.

                Checkout.com does not store a card's Card Verification Value (CVV) with its associated payment instrument. 
                
                To pass a CVV with your forward request, use the Frames SDK for <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/payments/accept-payments/accept-a-payment-on-your-mobile-app/accept-a-payment-on-your-android-app#Tokenize_a_CVV">Android</a> or <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/payments/accept-payments/accept-a-payment-on-your-mobile-app/accept-a-payment-on-your-ios-app#Tokenize_a_security_code">iOS</a> to collect and tokenize the CVV and pass the value in this field.
                
                The token will replace the placeholder `{{card_cvv}}` value in `destination_request.body`.

                Checkout.com does not store a card's PIN with its associated payment instrument. 
      
                In specific regions, card holders must enter the first two digits of their 4-digit card PIN to confirm card ownership.  
      
                To provide the first 2 digits of the PIN with your forward request:  
      
                1. Collect the PIN from the user.  
                2. tokenize it using the  `/tokens` [endpoint](/#operation/requestAToken) setting `type` to `pin`.  
                3. Pass the resulting  `token` value of the response in this field.  
      
                This token replaces the `{{card_pin}}` placeholder value in `destination_request.body`.

    OAuth:

      description: |
        Your OAuth credentials include an access key ID and an access key secret. They correspond to an OAuth 2.0 client ID and a client secret respectively. 
        
        To exchange these credentials for an access token, call the [Request an access token](#tag/Access/paths/~1connect~1token/post) endpoint. Authenticate using basic authentication, with your access key ID as the username and your access key secret as the password.
      
        | Environment   |      Authorization server                            |
        |---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
        | Sandbox       |  https://{prefix}.access.sandbox.checkout.com/connect/token   |

        --data-urlencode 'client_id=ack_...' \
        --data-urlencode 'client_secret=...' 
        ```
      
        The token server returns a Bearer `access_token` in JSON Web Token (JWT) format. Use this token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests.
      
        ```
        curl --location --request POST 'https://{prefix}.api.checkout.com/{{path}}' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'Accept: application/json' \

          ...
        }'
        ```
      
        The `expires_in` field in the response indicates the validity period of your access token in seconds. When your token expires, you must request a new one.
      
        Depending on the Environment against which you're making your requests against you'll need to request the token from a different Authorization Server.
      
        | Environment   |      Authorization Server                            |
